Alright, let's see here.
So, you’re the new rookie for Nexus experimental division?
Well, let me pull the veil back now, working here isn’t sunshine and rainbows, 
but as long as you keep your head down and don’t ask questions, 
everything will be fine. I got a whole thing to read here, but 
word of advice, keep a thick skin, and don’t think too hard about what you hear. 
Trust me, it's better that way.
Okay,
Welcome to your new position at NEXUS LLC.
You have been selected as the newest member of our experimental testing unit 
as a simulation supervisor, where you will evaluate and analyze
fully theoretical situations. Each shift, you will be 
given a list of 3 tests that you will need to complete. 
Select each box to display more information about the experiment..
Once all tests are complete, you may move onto your next shift.
Thank you for choosing NEXUS LLC.
Wow, I forgot how unhelpful that is. 
Anyways, the name’s [REDACTED]
Right, names aren’t allowed here. 
Apparently something went down at another facility, they don’t exactly tell me much.
Not like I use that name much anyways, I'm supervisor 866, you can call me Sixer.
Now, I won’t keep you waiting, open your first test and get started,
Nexus might not be the friendliest folks on the planet, 
but at least they are nice and only give you one experiment for the first shift, 
so read over the details, then click the Initialize test button to get started. 
Once you've gotten started, I’ll give you more information once you’ve gotten started.

Welcome back Rookie,
Word from the higher ups have come down, 
threat levels are gonna be going up sooner than expected.
You got 3 tests in front of you now, tackle them in any order you like, 
just get them done. Corporate has also now requested
all experiments implement secondary test parameters. 
Between you and me, if you don’t get them done, it's not the end of the world. 
Your panel will indicate if the parameter is met, but you can still complete your shift
no matter what. If it helps I was snooping around
and found some weird encrypted audio files on that machine they sent you. 
Completing those objectives makes me look good, so get them done
and I can take some time to decrypt that data for you. 
I don’t really know what it is, probably just junk from the last person
to have that machine that they didn’t bother purging,
but it might be something to check out in between tests if you need a break,
it's your call.

Hey rookie, 
Looks like you are getting settled into things
which is good, but there has been something weird going on with the system recently.
As far as I can tell, simulations are running as normal, 
but some values and information points are being swapped out.
A few of the people under me have had this issue, but overall 
it hasn’t effected their work, and corporate doesnt seem to have a problem with it.
So nothing to worry about right now, but I’ll do some digging and keep you posted. 
If you notice anything weird, just- try to ignore it
until I have more information.
I will get to the bottom of this 
and keep you informed if i find anything.

Greetings employee. Your department has served its purpose, 
complete final test, then delete all job related data from your terminal.
Failure to comply will result in criminal prosecution.
Once all data has been cleared, your final check will be deposited.
Thank you for choosing NEXUS EXPERIMENTAL TESTING UNIT, 
this will be your final communication.
